  <h2><center>Are aliens demons or what?</center></h2>
  <p class ="one">I figured i'd address one of my favourite topics in the subject as a starter, and that is the question of wether or not aliens are 'demons'. To answer, or at least discuss that, I think we need to establish a few things. Firstly i think the term 'demon' is thrown around a lot nowadays and possibly more often than not by somebody not actually referring to a religiously canonical demon, I also think that people often that don't consider the fact that not everything has either; the same world view as us, the same ethics or morals as us or the same feelings/emotions and reactions as us., basically I think the word evil and use of the word devil or more often "demonic in nature" is a very subjective term and should be limited to cases where the outcome of ones actions are the result of a not ENTIRELY necessary action. Obviously we have absolute zero concrete evidence on the background, origin, race, species, whaetever of aliens, if in fact UFO's/UAP have anything to do with "aliens" to begin with, but i think we can pretty easily arrive at a conclusion by process of eimination and use of the limited facts we have available to us. I think one of the main problems here and the undying association of aliens with demons has a lot to do with history, in the good old days, (the days when your grandads grandad had to drag a cart with sqaure wheels to school 3 miles a day), people had very little frame of reference to describe anything they saw or experienced that fell outside of their current lexicon and the current technologies of the time, they did however have one thing and that thing was religious texts.<br><br>

  Quick disclaimer; this is NOT intended to 'disprove/debate/anything at all' religious views or beliefs, its pure discussion and religion isn't a topic i plan on straying in to. That said, phenomena in the sky aren't a new thing, and by phenomena I don't exclusively mean UFO's and UAP. I mean things like solar flares, solar events, tricks of the light in the sky, tricks of the eye/mind, plasma discharge in the sky, aurora borealis, the list goes on, my point is that the only real source of information that people had to rely on before we fully understood these natural (and yes, sometimes unnatural phenomena) was often their [insert religious text of choice]. It's no secret that pretty much every holy book contains multiple references to what can easily be viewed as being a UFO, from the Hindu vimanas, to lights in the sky mentioned in the bible, to even the physical description of seraphim in the bible, (wheels within wheels etc). It really isn't difficult to see why between this and the various interpretations of some bible passages, (Ephesians 2:2; Satan is the prince of the power of the air), that UFO's and aliens have become for some intwertwined. For those who chose to believe this and base this phenomena within their faith im perfectly fine with that and i'm not looking to change any opinions, I just want to point out that theres been a precedent of this type of thing happening, from a biblical belief of a firmament and us gaining a greater understanding of science and eventually breaking through that firmament, to the geocentricism theory and that dark heretic Galileo, my point here isn't to disprove religion and in all honesty i think i'd be wasting my time in doing so regardless, religion has a way of adapting to change and in fact, growing stronger because of it. <br><br>

  So why the demon thing? I genuinely believe that what's happened is we've been encountering something that we have absolutely 0 scientific explanation for and the only other place where we can find something similar to what were seeing just so happened to be religious text or first hand accounts of witnesses from antiquity when religion was a much more powerful ruling force in peoples lives. On top of this the actions of these "others" to us, at times, has indeed seemed the be malevolent and even I myself view some of the actions of the phenomena as pointing towards being somewhat malevolent, after all, being taken from your bed in the middle of the night to be probed, operated on etc isn't most peoples idea of a good time, but if it is you do you. Regardless, i think a lack of understanding often leads us to assume to worst, as humans we fear the unknown and it's that fear that has helped us survive and evolve, but even knowing this and being aware of it it can often be difficult to overcome ones more natural processes. Another aspect of the phenomena which hasn't helped the others public image is the fact that, in my opinion, it's looking more and more like whatever is behind it resides within a dimension we have no way of seeing, processing or experiencing and again it's a trait that goes hand in hand with demonic entities, going off some of the more reliable theories put out by people like Carl Sagan, a being inhabiting a dimension we have no perception of would more than likely posses abilities that at first glance we might associate with the paranormal/supernatural. I think the issue is, even if we worked out what aliens are tomorrow, I wouldn't be sure it would be fair to come out and say that those who believed they were demons were wrong. I think people are using the term demon to describe something that isn't exactly a religiously canoniniclal demon either through lack of understanding or just through ease of association. If a a being that resides a dimension above us happens to need to feed on our negative energy to survive does that really make it a demon? Does the fact that i rely on the death of a chicken to make a sunday dinner make my a demon? Perhaps the chicken does in fact see me as a demon, but its more through perspective than anything else. <br><br>

It's concerning to hear it confirmed that there are elements in official places who legitimately believe we need to stop pursuing this topic because it is in fact demonic in nature, lets assume they're 100% correct about it and these things are demons, if they're demons by the traditional sense then how exactly is us attempting to learn more about them going to put us at any more risk? Surely a demon has enough power over us already that us learning where/why/what about them is going to be put them at such a disadvantage that they're going to need to do something drastic, and if they really are demons then it's hard to imagine they're not already getting what they need from us, regardless of our level of awareness. More to the point, if they are, by the religious term, demons, then one might assume that also implies the existence of a creator who is to some extent keeping them in line, I mean, if there isn't why are they not running absolutely amok, furthermore again, if they are real then where exactly is the logic in not confirming this coming from a person of faith? The knowledge of the existence of the demons is ONLY going to lead to a massive influx into religion, and i mean isn't that sort of one of the ideas? spreading the word? these all sounds like actions a demons would take to be honest. I jest of course,..sort of.. At the end of the day there's going to be undoubtedly tough questions and some of them are going to lead some people to some saddening places, but this is nothing unique , nor has it not happened before, in fact it's how we grew as a species, like it or not, whatever "it" is, it's here and us burying our heads in the sand over it isn't going to lead to solutions nor is it going to help anyone. </p>
