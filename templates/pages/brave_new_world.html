	<h1 class="one"><center>Brave New World<center></h1>
	<p class="one">The world of ufology can now be pretty easily split into two seperate eras: pre nimitz and post nimitz. If 2016 was the chinese year of the monkey. 2017 was the year of the UFO. It began in december when the new york times dropped two front page articles titled; "Glowing auras and Black Money" and "2 Navy Airmen and an Object that Accelerated Like Nothing Ive Ever Seen." The fact that someone as reputable as the New York times was willing to even touch the UFO object, let alone give it the front page, was a major victory for sky watchers worldwide. It signalled a major change in attitude regarding the subject and began the long, ongoing process of destigmatisation. Better late than never right?<br><br>The reason the release of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rWOtrke0HY">Tic Tac</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxVRg7LLaQA">Go Fast</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf1uLwUTDA0">Gimbal</a> are so important has nothing to do with quality, timing or setting, it's the fact that just two years later, two spokespersons for the pentagon, Susan Gough and Joseph Gradisher, confirmed that the videos were indeed Navy videos and that the objects captured in them were classed as "Unidentified aerial phenomena". This added yet more legitimacy to an already pretty solid event, we had multiple different confirmations that something had been present, radar operators, pilots and other eye witnesses had seen the objects, not just on the day of the video it turns out, but multiple times in the weeks preceding as well. It's pretty difficult to overstate just how important this event has been for ufology.</p>
		
	<h2 class="one">To The Stars Academy of arts and science</h2>
	<p class="one">A company widely cited as being responsible for a surge in interest in UFO's is the To the stars...academy of arts and science <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Stars_(company)">TTSA</a>. Founded in 2017, TTSA describes itself as an "award winning entertainment company that creates original content informed by their experiences working with prestigous government agencies and academic institutions". Headed by Tom Delonge, the board of directors and advisors consists of an extremely impressive set of individuals, including but not limited to, various 25 year+ CIA veterans, advisors to the DOD and NASA and a slew of highly qualified medical experts. The Tom Delonge story itself is an absolute rollercoaster of UFO's, spooks and government, but his contributions and efforts in ufology can't be ignored. TTSA's "Virtual Analytics UAP Learning Tool" (VAULT) team was responsible for the original release of the Go fast, FLIR and Gimbal videos, years before they were confirmed as being authetic by the Pentagon. The videos were released as part of Luis Elizondo's attempt to bring light to a special access program being ran by the DOD, AATIP.</p>

	<h2 class="one">Elizondo and AATIP</h2>
	<p class="one">Luis Elizondo is an ex CIA agent and previous the director of Global secuirty/special programs for To the stars academy, more importantly however, he is the former director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Indentification Program (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Aerospace_Threat_Identification_Program">AATIP</a>. AATIP (apparently now defunct) was one of the governments more recent studies into UFO's/UAP's. Running from 2007-2012 AATIP was involved not only in the study of UFO's, but also looked into areas such as "Applications of anti-gravity", "Stargates" "Advanced concious AI" and many other cutting edge technical areas.<br><br>

	Many question Elizondo's credibility, however that is not the goal here, not that it matters, but personally I believe that Elizondo has by now more than shown that even if he wasn't in the positions he claimed, he's more than educated enough and "in the know" to be classed as an authority on the subject, as such it will not be my aim to dissect the legitimacy of his claims or beliefs, merely to express what they are.<br><br>

	Having headed AATIP for five years, Elizondo eventually retired and turned whistleblower in 2017, revealing in an interview with journalist Leslie Kean the existence of AATIP, in the interest of national security, quoting his reasons for leaving as "Bureaucratic challenges and inflexible mindsets" amongst others. Elizondo believes that a much more public and open conversation needs to be held on the subject of UAP, he has stated on many occasions that the fact that they are here is not going to change just because we aren't discussing it and that it is vital to national security that we learn their capabilities and intents.<br><br>

	Elizondo has been instrumental in destigmatising the subject and bringing the discussion into public light, following his TTSA resignation elizondo has extensively toured the podcast circuit, he often references the metaphysical aspect of the phenomena and discusses "fringe" subjects such as conciousness regularly.

	<h2 class="one">So where are we?</h2>
	<p class="one">It's difficult to put together any "official" timeline of event since 2017, because they have been so numereous and intertwined but i'll try to put together a relatively clear explanation of where we are right now concerning UAPs/UFOs.<br><br>

	As stated we're now in the "post nimitz" era, the decade of the Tic Tac, the golden years of disclosure, call it what you will, what maybe seems quite obvious to some of us; is that <em>something</em> has happened. Full disclosure (pun intended) these are my own views and takes on what has happened and what is happening, but i find it's a view that often resonates with a lot of people in the UFO community, take from that what you will.<br><br>

	What exactly do i mean when i say <em>something</em> has happened? Well, when we look at how the government has treated the UFO phenomena, pretty much since its inception, we see one pattern, stifle the truth, dispense disinformation and generally confuse the field.

	Example? Roswell, New Mexico; lets assume for a minute, as was reported originally by the Roswell army air field, mind you, that something not of terrestrial origin crashed as Roswell. It took one day before the press release was recanted and the recovered object went from being a crashed flying saucer, to a crashed weather balloon, there's rumours that custody of the wreckage changed hands on day 2, and when this happened the chain of command went up a level, and the new head of that chain decided that telling the public that aliens had crashed in the desert wasn't the best idea. Jesse Marcel himself, assigned to recovery and analysis of the wreckage, publically claimed he had recovered tin foil and other parts of a weather balloon, even going as far as to pose with a weather balloon, yet post retirement claims that the material recovered was <em>not</em> of terrestrial origin, and that a piece of metal, as thin as aluminium foil, could be hit with a sledgehammer and no change in its structure was observed, for the average reader, this amount of flipping and flopping is already getting a bit ridiculous, but Roswell was just warming up at this point, later added to the story was the possibility that multiple spacecraft had actually crashed, bodies were recovered, one of these bodies wasn't an inanimate body, it was a live alien, other accounts have it that all of the aliens were dead and were taken to a hospital nearby, a local nurse actually <strong>saw</strong> dead aliens, laid out on gurneys. It's getting confusing right? The Air Force thought so too, so in 1994 they published a tell all account of Roswell claiming that what had been recovered was actually a nuclear test surveillance balloon, from the top secret Project Mogul, a project that saw microphones attached to balloons sent to high altitudes with the goal of detecting soviet A-bomb tests and in 1997 cleared up the alien bodies part of the story, they were just test dummies they'd dropped from altitude.<br><br>

	It's a bit much isn't it? Its a LOT of information and a tactic taken straight from intelligence workbooks is plausible deniability, lets say in 1970 the US government had started to design a Death Star, what better way to help cover up its existence, than a few years before this Death Star is due to launch into orbit, to release a fictional Sci Fi film where a Death Star is a prominent theme, so now anyone who decides to blow the whistle on the USS Death Star is going to be laughed at and reminded that Star Wars was just a movie. It's a pretty silly example, but it gets the point across, on a more serious note, disinformation isn't a conspiracy theory, its an active part of intelligence work. For an example based in reality: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Book">Project Blue Book</a>.<br><br>

	I understand that's a pretty lengthy explanation, but i wanted to get a point across, Roswell is a small sample taken from the many, many times that something like has happened surrounding a UFO event, sighting etc, so considering that such effort has gone into ridiculing the UFO community and getting to the point that anyone who dares go near it is risking academic suicide and a family intervention, it seems quite strange that what we're witnessing now is approaching what we might call a 180.

	It's not quite a complete 180 as of yet, after all, Luis Elizondo has faced <strong>fierce</strong> opposition, including attempts by active members of the government to completely discredit him, but on the other side of the coin, active members of the government have also come out in support of him, so its clear that there is still a holdout going on, a lot of the problems arise from the fact that some of the Special Access Programs (SAP's) involved in the research into UAP have been operating outside of congressional oversight, this is pretty much its own issue and is a red tape nightmare, but it's also a good answer to an often asked question "How could someone as high as the president possibly not be aware of what's going on?". Security clearances aren't the only thing governing access to classified material, SAP access is granted on a need to know basis, and if there isn't a fleet of hostile UFO parked in low earth orbit, it's entirely feasible that someone decides the current president doesn't need to know.<br><br>

	It's entirely possible that all of this is happening because its just a perfect storm of the right individuals doing the right things at the right time; Tom Delonge proposing the government rebrands it image, heads butting in US politics over budgets and a lack of congressional oversight, people rallying around Luis Elizondo, the list goes on and hey, i might just be paranoid, but im eternally skeptical of the government, so when the pentagon comes out and confirms that certain high definition gun camera/FLIR recordings are in fact UFO's, when the usual M.O is to either not comment or deny, then it makes me ask questions.<br><br>

	<h2 class="one">Disclosure..?</h2>
	<p class="one">One of the most bandied around questions/responses around the disclosure issue is that disclosure has already happened, and to be honest, it sort of has, I think the "issue" is that disclosure hasn't exactly happened how some people expected it to, no one has come out and said "Aliens are here". and that's because we can't really say they are here. We know somethings here, but we don't know what that something is and our governments aren't really into the guessing game. I think a lot of the frustration stems from the fact that the people we hear from on the subject are generally people who are already invested in the subject and thus have pretty much already accepted some form of the statement "Aliens are here/something unknown to us is here", and these people aren't learning anything new, the beginning of disclosure was always going to be both slow and aimed at a person who can be described as; having heard of UFO's, probably having little-no interest in them and thus, knowing nothing about them.<br><br>



	Take for instance the 2021 UFO report and the 2022 congress hearing on UAP. If you haven't seen the <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/20973253/uap-20210625.pdf">Preliminary Assesment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena</a> If we look at this report through the eyes of someone already familiar with the subject, all this really is, is an affirmation of what we already know, something's in the air, we don't really know what it is or where its from, but I think this report should be looked at through the eyes of somebody it was probably aimed at; that person with little-no interest in UFO's. If you're that person, then this is probably going to be pretty much your first "serious" introduction to the subject and its also quite importantly, one of the very first statements we've received from an official channel on the phenomena, and so what it does is pretty reasonable for what it is, it lays out what the phenomena is, what's used to identify it, what the government has been doing in response to it and a small read between the lines explanation of what could possibly be behind it. At the end of the day, no one knows what UFO's/UAP's really are, we're unsure if the government actually <strong>knows</strong> what they are either, and even if they do, they were never going to drop such a bombshell on what is a lot of peoples introduction to the topic.<br><br>


 	As for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LGjFkx3KnI">U.S Congress hearing on UFO/UAP</a>, I think this was a bit different, this was esentially the follow up to the UAP report and it wouldn't be unreasonable to hope that we might maybe learn a thing or two, instead what we got was what a lot of us in the community are used to and expected, a lot of nothing. This is where a lot of, in my opinion, well founded frustration came from. If anything the UAP report was two steps forward, and the congress hearing was one step back. It seemed like someone had suddenly decided disclosure wasn't actually a good idea and that going back to the roots of "we dont know/we need more data/we need more [excuse]" was a good idea. We were expected to believe that the typical data an intelligence agency that has been interested in this phenomena for over 70 years has to work with, is a 0.01 second video of "something" zooming past a cockpit, which couldn't even be seen without pausing the video and edging through it frame by frame and even when the "object" was on screen, it was honestly a whole lot of nothing. This was a perfect opportunity to further disclosure, it's hard to imagine if disclosure is the end goal here, why we weren't shown a decent quality video of a UFO, with a clear view of it, even for just a few seconds. Honestly, we get it, the very definition of a UFO is usually that it's difficult to observe, no one was expecting the government to wheel a flying saucer out on a trolley, nor are we expecting miracles when we know the data is notoriously difficult to work with, but pretending that programs that have had, probably well over $100M dollars poured into them, are working with blink and you'll miss it split second flashes of objects isn't really working.<br><br>

	The second issue is the relying on "classified systems and methods" to avoid answering questions and presenting any evidence. It's a solid reliable for the panicked official, if in doubt, claim that answering a question would reveal a classified information gathering secret or method, don't get me wrong, I dont expect the US government to come out and announce the specifications of their underwater hydrophone network, nor do I want to see a picture of a UFO with metadata identifying the capabilities of classified sensors, but there's a pretty simple workaround here, blur the pictures, remove identifying timestamps/information overlays, don't publish pictures that might be geo-located. The fact that these excuses are still being relied on just demonstrates the fact that there is still major reluctance for one reason or another, which is directly in conflict with the sudden shift in attitude towards disclosure, again leading us to question, <em>why</em> the big shift?<br><br>Maybe im just naturally skeptical, but i guess time will tell.</p>

	<h2 class="one">Woo to you too</h2>
	<p class="one">Leading us nicely into a personal tangent, that I think might actually be responsible for a lot more of the conflict than people give it credit for, and that is the subject of ~woo~, here's the issue, as soon as you start to stray even slightly outside the boundaries of what is accepted academic science, you're dangerously close to straying into the forbidden territory of woo, lets take a quick look at how attitudes have changed regarding the nature of UFO's over time. Originally the nuts and bolts theory was pretty much accepted as the explanation, flying saucers were from venus, they were made of advanced alien metal and they were piloted by little green men, what helped it keep its title as the mainstream theory was the fact that it didn't take any leaps in its explanation, aliens are just another race, from another planet, who are just ahead of us in development, so their technology is better, no one has a problem with the theory itself because none of this takes any leaps, everything we're seeing can be (sort of) explained by currently known science. The problem is, as discussed in <a href="{% url 'pages:introtheories' %}">our theories page</a> the longer the extraterrestrial hypothesis stuck around, the less it made sense.<br><br>

	Over time there's been a gradual shift away from the nuts and bolts idea to a half nuts and bolts half dimensional idea, with some being of the belief now that the entire explanation is a dimensional thing and this shifting of beliefs introduces another little elephant into the room, it's pretty much a natural progression that the more faith we have in extra dimensions and entities that inhabit them being a real thing, the more we will start to wonder what else they impact in our lives. It's entirely possible that in receiving answers to the UFO question, we will end up with even more unanswered questions than we began with. Is it then the case that in revealing the nature of the UFO phenomena, other, possibly more shocking things will be learned by us? Is it this that makes some of those more in the know to think we aren't ready to know the truth?

	It's not really a big secret that official channels have long been interested in subject's we label as woo, the CIA ran Project Stargate, spending tens of millions over a course of 20 years on remote viewing, it's hard to believe an organisation like the CIA would invest 20 years into something that revolved around smoke, mirrors and parlour tricks, yet regardless of this, I dont think it ever reduces the shock of learning that official channels have been looking into subjects that the "rational" minded among us would balk at. So whilst I might be labelling subjects such as; Conciousness, Extradimensional entities and anti-gravity as woo right now, I'm pretty sure that one day that's going to change and i'm also pretty sure that disclosure is going to help do it.<br><br>

	As stated it's becoming increasingly apparent that official channels looking into UAP/UFO are also looking more and more into these fringe theories, so it stands to reason that with so much attention being put into subjects that are as covered, usually laughed at, the potential for new discoveries is probably quite high. This seems to especially be the case when listening to Luis Elizondo talk, rarely when talking about UFO's will he gave a an answer that stays within the scope of the UFO phenomena, instead he often branches out and makes analogies about times when humanity has been at the tipping point of a great precipice, or questions wether or not we are ready to take a good look at ourselves and ask ourselves some hard questions. In a lot of his more closely analysed and repeated quotes it's very hard to imagine how some of the things he says apply to UFO's alone and at times, he appears to answer a seperate question to the one asked, supplying an answer more suited to a question about the nature of conciousness, the nature of life and death or the subject of reality. If he really is part of the overall disclosure plan, then his role seems to very much be getting a feel for how ready we are to ask questions about our origins, how we are likely to react upon learning paradigm shifting information and from time to time, slipping us information as part of the slow drip process. </p>

	<h2 class ="one">Give it to me straight doc!</h2>
	<p class ="one">So we can we do with this information? Nothing really apart from wait, see what happens in the near future, see if there is more of a disclosure plan or if the government classes them saying "They're not ours, they're not our adversaries" means to the government, "We told you they were aliens!". Everything here on out is pure conjecture, but i do find thatthe following views resonate within the ufo community and that when speaking about the subject to like minded individuals this seems to be, more often than not, a general consensus.
		<ul>
			<li>The discussion about wether or not UFO's/UAP's are actually real is over, it was over a long time ago, the idea that people who believe in UFO's are conspiracy theorists is long dead. We need to start looking at evidence firstly to evaluate authenticity and then use the good data to <em>understand</em> the phenomena, not use it as "proof" of anything.</li>
			<li>Disclosure has been referred to as a two part process, we're currently in part 2, many consider the 5 years from 2017 - 2022: The nimitiz incident, the UAP report and the congress hearing as part 1.</li>
			<li>Something <em>might</em>have been learned, glimpsed or maybe even presumed about our reality that is groundbreaking information, it might be a physics breakthrough, it might be that we have found proof of another dimension, we dont yet know.</li>
			<li>Subjects once looked at as "woo", spririts, conciousness, the soul, beings from other dimensions, are quite likely to be very real and will one day, perhaps even soon, become hard fact, or maybe even just not classed as "fringe science".</li>
			<li>UFO's come from the space place as ghosts. I think its easier to process the extradimensional idea by related it to something everyone is already familiar with, you know how ghosts can appear where they want to? Fly through walls and doors? <strong>fly?</strong>. Yeah.</li>
		</ul></p>

		<p class ="one">
		<h3 class ="one">Statements and implications made by Luis Elizondo</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>It's not humanity, it's humanitie<em>'s'</em></li>
			<li>There is possibly something in our DNA that didn't get there by any natural means.</li>
			<li>It's entirely possible that we are no longer at the top of the food chain</li>
			<li>We might actually be sharing our planet with whatever the phenomena is, and as such, its possible there's nothing alien about it and it's also possible that they were actually here before us.</li>
