<h1 class ="one"><center>The Fermi Paradox<center></h1>
<p class ="one">One of the most asked questions regarding intelligent life in the universe is something along the lines of "Well if aliens are real where are they all?" and it's a fair question indeed. It's something that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> asked during a lunch with colleagues in 1950, and since then something along the line of "Where are they?" has been associated with or known as "The Fermi Paradox".<br> The fermi paradox can be looked at in a few ways but is generally thought as being presented as "Why is there no sign or evidence of aliens on earth or even nearby?" or "Why is it we seem to be alone in the universe?".</p>

<p class="one"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence">The search for extraterrestrial intelligence</a> has essentially been going on since the invention of radio, however even earlier than this Nikola Tesla suggested that he may have received signals from Mars whilst conducting experiments with wireless electrical transmission, since then there has been many projects set up purely in the SETI and while it may be easy to become disheartened by the fact that in that time, we have received only <em>one</em> potential signal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal">the WOW signal</a>, declaring that there is no life in the universe is comparable to taking a glass of water from the ocean and declaring the ocean must be void of life because we see none inside the glass.

<h2 class="one">Let's break things down</h2>
<p class="one">Despite the fact we haven't really done all that much searching ourselves, nor are we by any means at all anything other than young in the grand scheme of everything, there still remains the fact that the universe itself is extremely old. Follow the chain of reasoning: we know there are billions of stars similar to our sun, and that of those stars, there are stars older than our sun and of these suns, some will contain planets similar to ours, or goldilocks planets, planets that are "just right" for life. It seems unthinkable, given the scale of the universe, that the planet earth is either <strong>extremely</strong> rare or <strong>completely</strong> unique, so we can assume that other civilizations, older than ours will have or will exist. It is also logical to assume that these civilizations will have progressed to the point of interstellar travel during some point in their evolution, even using our own models of current interstellar travel speeds, our entire galaxy could be explored within a couple of million years. So given we can reasonably assume civilizations, much older than us (billions of years) will have reached the point of interstellar travel, why have no planets near us been colonised? Why is there no evidence of this having happened in the past? <em>Where is everyone</em>.</p>

<h2 class ="one">The Drake Equation</h2>
<p class ="one">In 1961 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Drake">Frank Drake</a> came up with an equation that could be used t>Drakeo estimate how many active civilizations are in our galaxy. The equation itself is a really good way of generating thought provoking conversation on ET life as it addresses the factors that need to be considered in it, but was never meant to be used or quoted as an accurate way of determining how prevalent alien life actually is. The problem lies in the fact that most of the figures used need to be estimated and we currently have no way of knowing the actual numbers to use, this means that the result of the equation is heavily dependent on how conservative the numbers used in it are and results can vary from the galaxy being teeming with life, to the galaxy being absolutely empty. It's definetly worth reading up on if you're interested in the Fermi paradox. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">Drake equation</a>.</p>

<h1 class="one"><center>Theories<center></h1>
<p class="one">There's a lot of theories and suggested answers to the fermi paradox and given that this is an entirely hypothetical situation there's nothing stopping you from coming up with your own ideas. I'll outline some of the more prevelant, popular and accepted answers below.</p>

<h2 class="one">Dark Forest Theory</h2>
<p class ="one">
Kill or be killed. Dark forest theory is the idea that there is indeed extraterrestrial life out there and it may even be plentiful, but we aren't able to contact these civilizations or detect signals from them because they aren't trying to be found in the first place. It's entirely possible that life out there is on the whole, hostile, and as such us sending out signals telling the universe where we are, what we look like and what our DNA looks like (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message">Aricebo message)</a> is actually a really bad idea. Whilst the aricebo message wasn't specifically an attempt to initiate contact and more a celebration of technical achievement, many scientists, Stephen Hawkins included, have warned against contact, citing what happened to the natives when Columbus landed in america as an analogy. He also theorised that its entirely possible alien life is actually nomadic, in which case they might view us as a source of resources more so than a star trek-esque away team opportunity.</p>

<h2 class="one">Rare Earth Hypothesis</h2>
<p class ="one">
	Rare earth hyopthesis puts forward the idea that the circumstances behind our planets formation and our evolution really are just really, really unlikely to happen. Considering the size of the universe this isn't actually as far fetched as it might seem at first glance, the conditions just for life to arise is a long list alone, let alone evolution to occur. Let's have a look at some of the boxes earth ticks
	<ul>
	<li>We're inside the galaxys habitable zone</li>
	<li>Jupiters position, size and gravitational pull protects us from comets</li> 
	<li>Moons the size of ours are necessary and rare</li>
	<li>Earth is the right size to maintain atmosphere, allowing water to exist here</li>
	<li>Plate tectonics are arguably necessary and there is reason to believe earth is the only planet in our solar system with them</li>
	<li>The conditions that spur life to progress from simple bacterias to complex life are rare</li> 
   	</ul>
   	<p class="one">This list is nowhere near exahustive, but shows that it's entirely possible that the circumstances for life to evovle really are just that rare.</p>

   	<h2 class="one">They are already here</h2>
   	<p class ="one">One of my personal favourites, this covers two possibilities, alien life is already on the planet and possibly just hides in places we aren't capable or exploring like the bottom of the ocean or inside volcanoes and the fact that a lot of sightings involve water and that its also a well known fact that volcanoes often have a high number of ufo reports around them might support this.<br><br>
   	The other possibility in this category is that alien life isn't actually "alien" at all, but live amongst us unseen, its entirely possible that something lives in a dimension that exists outside of our sensory perception and is just invisible to us. There's little point trying to explain this when someone like Carl Sagan has already done so, he explains the idea of the 4th dimension in a simple concise way here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiWKq57uAlk">Carl Sagan: Flatland</a>

   	<p class="one">The above is a small explanation of a few of the more popular answers to the paradox and hopefully acts an easily digested introduction, if you're interested in learning more I suggest starting at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Wiki</a>, and seeing what SETI has to say about it <a href="https://www.seti.org/fermi-paradox-0">here.</a>
