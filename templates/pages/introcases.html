	On June 8th 1947, Roswell Army Air Field reported that they had recovered a flying saucer from a ranch near to the air field, shortly afterwards this statement was recanted and a statement was reissued claiming that the object recovered was in fact a weather balloon. The event received relatively little attention until the 70's, when one of the key figures involved in the recovery of the debris, Jesse Marcel, was interviewed by Stanton Friedman and claimed that he believed the debris recovered <em>was</em> in fact extraterrestrial in origin. Roswell is one of, if not the, first event where a UFO has supposedly been recovered. Roswell is one of the most popular, frequently investigated cases in ufology with countless books and reports having been published on the event. Unfortunately with such attention being put on it there are so many different versions of events of what happened, from witnesses, to journalists to disinformation agents that the information available has been so flooded with differing accounts it is nigh impossible to determine what actually happened. Even Jesse Marcel, working for the Roswell army air field at the time, has changed his story from the official version of a weather balloon, to his claim that the material recovered was extraterrestrial in nature.<br><br><br><br></p>

	<h2 class ="one"><center>The WoW signal, 1977</center></h2>
	<p class="one">
	<img src="{% static 'pages/wow.jpg' %}" width="300px" style="float:left; margin: 10px;" alt="wow">
	In 1977 Jerry Ehman, volunteer for SETI, Ohio, was looking over the signals picked up by the "Big Ear" satellite a few days before when he came across a 6 figure string, 6EQUJ5. Astounded by the strength of the signal he circled it in red and wrote "WOW" next to it and thus, the wow signal was birthed. The signal strength system is pretty simple, it's a scale of 0 - Z, the numbers 0 - 9 followed by the letters A - Z, meaning 0-9 are very low power, whereas X,Y,Z are extremely high power, considering how close to the end of the alphabet Q and U are, its not hard to imagine Jerry's excitement. To this date we still aren't fully sure about the wow signal, we know it came from Sagittarius, but we aren't sure of its exact source. Why did it not repeat? Did something send it and move on or was it just one more thing in space that we are yet to understand? We've eliminated a number of possible sources for the signal, we have yet to eliminate deliberate communication as being one of them, no one is saying it must be aliens, but at the same time we have yet to rule them out and the wow signal remains one of the best candidates for communication from space.</p><br>

	<h2 class ="one"><center>Ariel school landing, 1994</center></h2>
	<img src="{% static 'pages/ariel.jpg' %}" width="300px" style="float:left; margin: 10px;" alt="ariel">
	<p class ="one">Ruwa, Zimbabwe, 1994. On the morning of september 16th 1994, students at the Ariel school were on their morning break, having gone outside to play a number of children, roughly 62, saw a number of silver objects in the sky which eventually either descended low or landed in brush beyond the school yard. As often do with accounts of mass ufo sightings, details differ, but in this case the general timeline of events and occurences are pretty much the same. Afer landing, beings described as anything from "normal looking men" to "grey aliens" emerged from the ship and either stood on the ship itself or somewhere in its vicinity. Several children received a telepathic message telling us we need to take better care of the planet and having done this, the beings left. As stated, details vary, but this is pretty much to be expected from children ranging from age 6-12, having what could be classed as a traumatic, or at the very least, extremely intense experience. What hasn't changed is a single one of the childrens stories to date. An excellent documentary was released in 2022, namely <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20216382">Ariel Phenomenon</a> which covers the event and even brings to light unseen evidence on it.<br><br><br><br>

	<h2 class ="one"><center>The Phoenix Lights, 1997</center></h2>
	<img src="{% static 'pages/phoenix.jpg' %}" width="300px" style="float:left; margin: 10px;" alt="p_lights">
	<p class ="one">One of the better known mass sightings, the phoenix lights occured on 13th March 1997, over a period of about 4 hours and over a distance of roughly 300 miles, no one really knows what exactly appeared over the city, but hundreds of witnesses agree, it was delta/V shaped, it was silent and it was huge. The craft appeared over the city and slowly and silently glided over the city, witnesses have estimated it's size as being "a couple of city blocks wide" or "the width of 3 football fields", the only sign it was really there were the lights beneath it and how the stars above were ominously blocked out by the apparently black craft as it passed by. Outrage followed the event shortly after when the current governor, Fife Symington held a press conference in which he claimed to have captured those responsible for the lights, only to bring his aide onto stage, dressed as an alien. Adding insult to injury, years later Symington himself admitted to having seen the lights himself, a former pilot, he told press he knew it wasn't anything of earthly origin. Hours after the event, in an unrelated incident, the air force flew four A-10 warthogs over the city on a training exercise and dropped numerous flares, as a result of which the two events are often confused and incorrectly "debunked" as having been flares.

	<h2 class ="one"><center>USS Nimitz: Tic tac, 2004<center></h2>
	<img src="{% static 'pages/tictac.jpg' %}" width="300px" style="float:left; margin: 10px;" alt="ttac">
	<p class ="one">In november 2004, the USS Nimitz was on a training mission 90 miles off the coast of San Diego. Two F/A-18 Super Hornets were on training operations when they were told to suspend their current activies for a real world task in which they were to investigate an unknown contact. Commander David Fravor was one of the pilots and first saw the object moving erratically over a patch of the sea, almost as if it was running a search pattern, as he grew closer he said the object seemed to become aware of his presence and moved towards him, Fravor anticipated where the object was heading and on attempting to cut the object off, said it instantly accelerated and vanished. This event was witnessed by Fravor, his weapons system officer (WSO) and the pilot and WSO of the other F/A-18. Later on the same day, this object was seen again by another F/A-18 that was equipped with an ATFLIR targetting pod camera piloted by Chad Underwood who managed to record the now infamous "tic tac video". The Nimitz encounter along with the pentagon confirming the legitimacy of the videos is arguably the most important event in ufology as it marked the beginning of the subject being destigmatised and taken a lot more seriously.
