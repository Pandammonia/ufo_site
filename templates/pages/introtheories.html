	<h1 class= "one"><center>Theories</center></h1>

	<p class="one">UFO's have been around since arguably antiquity and as such theories behind the origin of them, their purpose, who they are etc are in no short supply. I'll outline below some of the more common/commonly accepted theories in the subject.</p>

	<h2 class ="one">The Fermi Paradox</h2>
	<p class="one">Not so much a theory, more of a thought experiment of sorts <a href="{% url 'pages:fermi' %}">The fermi paradox.</a>
	</p>

	<h2 class ="one">It's the government/it's foreign technology</h2>
	<p class="one">It isn't. Here's why, at least I, dont believe it is. One of the better arguments against this is something Luis Elizondo has set out known as the five observables. These are a list of abilities demonstrated by truluy unexplainable flying objects, they are:
		<ol>
			<li>Defying gravity: objects can overcome the effects of gravity but have no visible means of propulsion or flight surfaces. A typical flying saucer has no visible engine and unlike a conventional aircraft, no visible means of generating lift either.</li>
			<li>Sudden instant acceleration: UFO's are seen accelerating <em>extremely</em> quickly, quicker than anything known to us. The g-force that would be produced by acceleration of this manner would crush a human or an aircraft</li>
			<li>Hypersonic speed without a signature: when an aircraft breaks the sound barrier it leaves a signature, it creates a sonic boom and there are vapor trails seen around the edges of flight surfaces. UFO reports, sightings and videos usually lack both.</li>
			<li>Low observability: Even when they are seen they are typically difficult to observe, they can be difficult to track on radar, often leaving the screen or moving instantly, they're notoriously difficult to capture on film and can't be seen clearly enough even by eye to describe, often changing shape, appearing as just a glow or disappearing entirely.</li>
			<li>Trans-medium capabilities: UFO's aren't limited by the medium they're travelling through, they can transition from space to our atmosphere to water effortlessly and none seem to effect their capabilities</li>
		</ol>

	<p class ="one">It's difficult to imagine how an aircraft demonstrating even <em>one</em> of these capabilities wouldn't demonstrate technical superiority over a nation without them, let alone all 5. If a nation on earth does possess this technology then why isn't it being used to anyone's advantage? Why haven't we seen some trickle down evidence of any of this technology existing in the consumer marketplace? Im not suggesting personal UFO's, I just find it extrem
		ely hard to believe that someone has conquered gravity and isn't basically cashing in on it. If we have, why are we using this technology to buzz aircraft carriers and hang around over lakes and forests? Nothing about this technology being ours makes sense to me.<br><br>People often forget the fact that the US government themselves have come out and admitted that they don't know what it is, this alone suggests that they have already confirmed it isnt terrestrial. If it turns out to be a secret chinese project and it turns out the entirety of the US intelligence service was tricked/misled it would be infinitely embarassing and its very hard to imagine they would make a statement of this magnitude without being 100% certain.</p>

	<h2 class ="one">Extraterrestrial hypothesis/nuts and bolts</h2>
	<p class="one">The ET hypothesis is the age old idea that aliens are explorers or a civilization from another planet/galaxy/not from this planet. This is the idea that they're little green men coming from Venus basically. Whilst its a long held idea that was often championed as the most likely I personally think the more we learn about the phenomena, the less likely this is becoming. One of UFOlogy's more respected figures <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vallee">Jacques Vallee</a> was once of this belief and originally set out to confirm it, over time however his view on this has changed and eventually shifted. I strongly recommend getting a copy of his book "Passport to magonia" in which he lays out the cases against this, a short summary is that:
		<ul>
			<li>There's now been far too many encounters for the reason to be anything like a survey of the planet, medical surveys etc. The abduction phenomena isn't slowing down, yet how could a visitor have not learned what they need to by now</li>
			<li>If they have the technology to cross the boundarys of space, why do they need to rely on us for something medical/survey related in the first place?</li>
			<li>Their technological prowess alone suggests they aren't here for something material or anything they need to rely on us to provide</li>
			<li>The fact aliens look so similar to humans suggests they can't have evolved elsewhere</li>
		</ul>
	<p class ="one">As a small aside, aliens looking similar to humans <em>can</em> possibly be explained using evolution theory and ideas like symmetrical evolution which i'll go into later.</p>
	<p class ="one">Nuts and bolts refers to the belief that UFO's are just that, made of nuts and bolts, and again whilst this was once the prevailing theory, common belief is shifting more away from this in favour of an extradimensional/intradimensional origin</p>
	<h2 class ="one">Extra/Interdimensional</h2>
	<p class="one">I've grouped these together because the difference is basically that an interdimensional being would live inbetween dimensions, whilst an extradimensional being would exist outside the known reality of our universe.
	I personally think the more we are "allowed" to know about has been confirmed and which directions official channel of investigation into the phenomena are going, the more likely this theory seems. It's a shame this idea wasn't adopted much sooner because it seems to be becoming more and more likely to be the correct one. Recent revelations from people like Luis Elizondo on the fact that the government has been pursuing much more "out there" ideas than anyone imagined and breakthroughs in quantum physics that suggest that we actually don't really understand what's going on around us very well at all (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment">The double slit experiment</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave-particle_duality">Wave-particle duality</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">Quantum entanglement</a>).<br><br>
	The idea essentially is that our reality isn't confined to the 3 dimensions we experience and there is in fact, many more we aren't able to perceive. It's in these extra dimensions that "aliens" exist in this idea, obviously everything involving this is heavily speculative, but its possible that if this were the case it would explain a lot of the supposed "supernatural" abilities that these beings possess. It's believed a 4d being would be able to interact with a 3 dimensional object in a way that defies our understanding of physics, they would be able to move through solid objects, move items through and past walls etc. It's also worth noting that some believe that the 4th dimension is an explanation for "ghosts" and other paranormal phenomena. The idea itself is a pretty big rabbit hole and links into other subjects like conciousness.

	<h2 class ="one">Aliens == Demons</h2>
	<p class="one">This idea can be looked at as being roughly the same as them being extradimensional. It's gained a bit of traction from people stating that abductions have been stopped before by invoking a religious figure of authority, however this evidence is often anecdotal and even if it has happened, there's nothing to say that what actually stopped the abduction was more due to the intent of the individual rather than the mention of a religious entity.

	A lot of the backing for this theory comes from the depiction of UFOs/lights/objects being depicted in some drawings and paintings of religious events and the fact that what could be viewed as UFO's/aliens are described in religious texts. It's entirely possible however that people were just decribing and drawing things they had seen using the vocabulary and current understanding of the time.

	Some point to the fact that the phenomena has shown signs of both intelligence and manipulation/deceit over time, however its also possible once again that this is just an incorrect interpretation through the lens of religion.

	Perosnally i think this is just an offshoot of aliens/UFO's being an extradimensional thing and a correlation/causation effect occuring.</p>

	<h2 class ="one">Space Jellyfish</h2>
	<p class="one">Okay so 'space jellyfish' might not be the best way to sum this idea up, but there does exist the idea that what were seeing isn't actually a vehicle at all and that UFO's themselves are biological entities, there's nothing to say that something hasn't evolved to survive in space and what we are seeing is an entity itself, UFO's after all have often been described as being intelligent and reacting to external stimuli, they have at times been seen acting almost "curiously", approaching aircraft as if trying to get a better look and almost toying with them. It's worth noting that there is a micro-animal called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade">Tardigrade</a> that can survive for decades without food, withstand extremely low temperatures and survive in space, to claim that something like a UFO couldn't be a biological being when considering the size and scope of the universe is nothing short of ignorant.</p>

	<h2 class="one">Future human's</h2>
	<p class ="one">Okay strap yourself in, this one is kinda wild. UFO's are us from the future, crazy right? There's a few trains of thought here, number one is that ufo's are just humans from the future that have invented time travel and are coming back for a number of possible reasons, one of these ideas is tourism; they're just coming back to see their ancestors up close and personal.<br><br>

	Howver, as with most things alien'y there's also a much grimmer hypothesis, there are those that believe that at some point in our future there's a huge disaster, nuclear war is a favourite, and a few hypotheticals result from that. One is that humanity ends up needing to live in underground bunkers because the surface is so irradiated and from this stems the idea that maybe that's why "greys" look the way they do, no natural light; pale skin, living underground; larger more light sensitive eyes and a lessening of diversity in the gene pool leading to an almost "deformed" look. Whilst i agree some of these add up (the pale skin), i think its much more likely that if anything would cause them to evolve those traits it would be living in space, regardless, this fallout-esque scenario leads to them having to come back in time to harvest DNA and save themselves.<br><br>The other scenario in the vein is roughly the same, only they're coming back to either warn us of the dangers of nuclear weapons or to avert disaster completely. Which leads us nicely into...</p>

	<h2 class="one">The nuclear connection</h2>
	<p class ="one">It's pretty hard to ignore the fact that UFO sightings really took off pretty much in sync with nuclear weaponry becoming a big thing, this isn't to completely ignore the pre-1940's sightings, but they were nowhere near the amount of post-1940's sightings. The first nuclear detonation was on July 16th 1945 at Los Alamos, New Mexico. In 1946 Lt Col Jesse Marcel was assigned to the 509th Composite Group, the 509th was the nuclear strike and deterrence core of strategic air command and until June 1948, it was the only unit capable of launching a nuclear strike. In the middle of all this occuring, July 8th 1947, the press team at Roswell army air field sent out a press release stating that they had recovered/captured a "flying saucer" only to retract it the following day and claim the object had in fact been, a weather balloon. Coincidentally Jesse Marcel, part of the atomic bomb testing at bikini atoll in 1946, was a key figure in the Roswell event.

	In 2001, Dr Steven Greer got together more than 20 witnesses to UFO phenomena, the panel of witnesses was diverse, ranging from ex NASA employees to former career air force officers. One particular witness, Robert Salas, claimed to have been stationed at Malmstrom AFB, Montana in 1967 as a Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander. In the spring of 1967 during an early morning shift, he testified that security guards topside had contacted him to report "lights" flying above the facility, a second more frantic phone call occured and within minutes 10 of the missiles under his command had went from being in a state of alertness to essentially being shut down. The failsafes in place mean that it is unlikely that <em>one</em> missile will go down and not come back online, let alone 10.

	Salas was not the only person present at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i-48LpRB9c">Disclosure Project of 2001 - Hosted at the National Press Club</a> nor was he the only person to testify that UFO's had been seen interacting with nuclear weaponry. </p>

	<h2 class="one">Aleister Crowley</h2>
	<p class ="one">A lesser known connection in UFO'logy involves Aleister Crowley a.k.a The wickedest man alive. Crowley an occultist, was known for frequently conducting sex magick rituals and it was during one of these rituals he claims to have come into contact with a being he referred to as "Lam". He drew a portrait of Lam and some have commented on how similar <a href ="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.b1qEiDzOznb-sNW2JAVKXQHaJQ?pid=ImgDet&rs=1">Lam</a> is to a <a href="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.0HsngNMf1Hr-MZljCiamgQHaJn?pid=ImgDet&rs=1">Grey alien</a>. Crowley first contacted "Lam" in 1918.
